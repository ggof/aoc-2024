# aoc-2024

My solutions to Advent Of Code 2024, in Clojure. I've decided I really wanted to learn Clojure this year, so what better than solve small, varied problems?

To keep in line with the AoC guidelines, the inputs are not commited.

## Usage

Every day has it's own alias to be run via the `clj` executable. To solve a problem, first download (or copy-paste) the problem's input under `inputs/day<day number>.txt`. Then, you can execute the proper solver by typing:

    clj -X:day<day number>
